        Hello, my name is <span class="inline-text">Ridhima Garg</span>. I am 20 years old. I am currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science with a specialisation in Data Science from VIT Vellore. As of now, I have completed programming languages: <span class="inline-text">Python</span>, <span class="inline-text">C</span>, <span class="inline-text">C++</span>, and <span class="inline-text">Java</span>. But I am more familiar with <span class="inline-text">C</span> and <span class="inline-text">Java</span> for now. I am currently doing a course on web designing using HTML. I passed my 12th with <span class="important">93%</span> and 10th with <span class="important">95%</span>.

        I am a very private person and don’t usually open up easily to strangers. Also, I am an emotionally sensitive and quiet person. I have a very deep interest in sports, especially badminton. I also played badminton for 1 year. I also learnt swimming, but I’m not very good at it. I like to read e-books. My go-to books are generally fictional. I also enjoy gardening.
    </p>

        My future plans are centred around growth, fulfilment, and staying true to myself. I envision a life where I can find balance between my personal dreams and the needs of those who I care about. <span class="highlight">Stability</span> matters a lot to me, but so does passion. Travel might be a part of my future—seeing new places, finding quiet beauty in unfamiliar corners of the world, and discovering parts of myself along the way.
