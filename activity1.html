    Hello my name is Ridhima Garg. I am 20 years old. I am currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer Science with specialisation as Data Science from VIT Vellore.  As of now I have completed programming languages, python, c, cpp and java. But I am more familiar with c and java for now. I am currently doing a course of web designing using HTML. I passed my 12th with 93% and 10th with 95%.
</p>
<p>
    I am a very private person and don’t usually open up easily to strangers. Also, I am an emotionally sensitive and quite person. I have a very deep interest in sports specially badminton. I also played badminton for 1 year. I also learnt swimming but I’m not very good at it. I like to read e-books. My go to books is generally fictional. I also enjoy gardening
</p>
<p>
    My future plans are centred around growth, fulfilment, and staying true to myself. I envision a life where I can find balance between my personal dreams and needs of those who I care about. Stability matters a lot to me, but so does passion. Travel might be a part of my future, seeing new places, finding quiet beauty in unfamiliar corners of the world, and discovering parts of myself along the way.
