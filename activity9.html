        <img src="your-image.png" alt="My Image">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Hello, my name is Ridhima Garg. I am 20 years old. I am currently pursuing B.Tech. in Computer
        Science with specialization in Data Science from VIT Vellore. As of now, I have completed
        programming languages, Python, C, CPP, and Java. But I am more familiar with C and Java for now. I am
        currently doing a course in web programming using HTML. I passed my 12th with 93% and 10th with 95%.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>My Personality</h2>
        I am a very private person and don’t usually open up easily to strangers. Also, I am an emotionally
        sensitive and quiet person. I have a very deep interest in sports, especially badminton. I also played
        badminton for 1 year. I also learned swimming but I’m not very good at it. I like to read e-books. My go-
        to books are generally fictional. I also enjoy gardening.
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Future Plans!</h2>
        My future plans are centered around growth, fulfillment, and staying true to myself. I envision a life
        where I can find balance between my personal dreams and the needs of those who I care about. Stability
        matters a lot to me, but so does passion. Travel might be a part of my future, seeing new places,
        finding quiet beauty in unfamiliar corners of the world, and discovering parts of myself along the
        way.
